# islev-scuba-dive-web-app
## A web app for Islev Scuba Dive Club. 
They requested us to do a makeover of their web site and add functionality to their website like: 
- login to their website
- creating and managing dicing courses and club members.

We worked using **SCRUM** for our development process.

For manipulation and reading of the database we used **Java Persistance API (JPA)**.

We experienced working with other API's like:
- Bootstrap - getbootstrap.com/
- Google API Calendar - developers.google.com/calendar/
- Google API Maps - developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/guide
- jQuery - api.jquery.com/
